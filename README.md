# Static site generator.

Work in progress.

This is a project/package I've built simply to make a simple static site generator for some of my personal projects. This is not intended to be standalone and should be integrated into an app in order to properly leverage the package.
 
I created this partly because I needed to get some static files generated for one of my side projects and partly just to see how difficult it would be. The setup I developed this for is a Laravel application that acts as a sort of personal dashboard but also to help manage some of the basic sites that are being put up as a result of other side projects. 

## TODO

- Documentation
- Laravel integration
- Proper demo site in project and live.
- Unit tests
- Proper README file

## Nice to have

- Helper to build the "definition object"
- Demo site should be the documentation site.
